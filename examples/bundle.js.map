It uses\n * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\n *\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\n *\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n */\nclass Calendar extends React.Component {\n static propTypes = {\n\n   /**\n    * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\n    */\n   elementProps: PropTypes.object,\n\n   /**\n    * The current date value of the calendar.
